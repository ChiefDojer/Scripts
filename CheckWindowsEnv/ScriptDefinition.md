# Ultimate Windows Developer Environment Checker (v3.2)

## Definition

The **Ultimate Windows Developer Environment Checker** is a comprehensive PowerShell diagnostic script designed to audit and validate the presence, configuration, and versions of development tools, runtimes, frameworks, and system features installed on Windows systems. It provides developers with a complete overview of their development environment in a single execution.

---

## Overview

This automated auditing tool systematically checks over 50 different development tools, platforms, and system features across multiple technology stacks. It provides color-coded output with detailed version information, making it easy to identify missing dependencies, outdated tools, or configuration issues.

### Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Checks tools across 11 major categories
- **Version Extraction**: Displays actual version numbers, not just presence/absence
- **Smart Detection**: Searches beyond PATH for tools like 7-Zip and Visual Studio
- **Error Resilience**: Continues execution even when individual checks fail
- **Clean Output**: Color-coded results with organized sectional display
- **Summary Report**: Consolidated status table at completion
- **Non-Destructive**: Read-only operations with no system modifications

---

## Technical Architecture

### Script Structure

The script is organized into the following components:

1. **Initialization Block**: Sets up variables and displays script header
2. **Core Function**: `Check-Command` - Reusable verification logic
3. **Category Sections**: Organized checks for different tool types
4. **Error Handling**: Try-Catch-Finally blocks for graceful failure recovery
5. **Summary Generation**: Results compilation and display

### The `Check-Command` Function

```powershell
function Check-Command {
    param(
        [string]$cmd,           # Command to execute
        [string]$name,          # Display name
        [string]$arg,           # Argument (default: --version)
        [string]$Parser         # Optional regex for version extraction
    )
}
```

**Function Workflow:**
1. Executes the command with specified arguments
2. Captures both stdout and stderr (using `2>&1`)
3. Validates exit code and output presence
4. Cleans multi-line output to single-line version string
5. Applies optional regex parsing for custom extraction
6. Stores results in the global `$results` hashtable
7. Displays color-coded output (Green for success, Red for failure)

### Advanced Detection Techniques

#### Registry-Based Discovery
For tools not in PATH (e.g., 7-Zip, Visual Studio):
- Searches Windows Registry for installation paths
- Checks both 32-bit and 64-bit registry hives
- Validates file existence before execution

#### File Metadata Reading
For executables that hang on execution (e.g., `devenv.exe`):
- Reads version information from file properties
- Extracts ProductVersion and ProductName
- Avoids launching GUI applications

#### Dual-Mode Checks
For tools with multiple installation methods (e.g., Docker Compose):
- Attempts modern plugin-based approach first
- Falls back to legacy standalone installation
- Reports which variant was detected

## Category Breakdown

### 1. Windows Platform Features

| Check | Purpose | Method |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **WSL Status** | Validates Windows Subsystem for Linux | `wsl --status` command |
| **Virtualization** | Checks Hyper-V/Virtual Machine Platform | `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature` cmdlet |

**Importance**: Essential for Docker Desktop, containerized development, and Linux-based workflows.

### 2. Core System Tools

| Tool | Typical Use Case |
|------|------------------|
| **PowerShell** | Built-in version detection via `$PSVersionTable` |
| **Git** | Version control for source code management |
| **VS Code** | Primary code editor verification |
| **7-Zip** | Archive manipulation and compression |
| **CMake** | Cross-platform build system generator |
| **Make** | Build automation tool (Unix-style) |

**Special Handling**: 7-Zip uses registry-based discovery with custom parsing of non-standard output.

### 3. Python Ecosystem

Comprehensive Python development stack validation:

- **Python Interpreter**: Base runtime check
- **pip**: Package installer with custom dual-version display (pip version + Python version)
- **pipx**: Isolated CLI application installer
- **Poetry**: Modern dependency management and packaging
- **Pipenv**: Virtual environment and dependency manager
- **venv Module**: Tests actual virtual environment creation (not just presence)

**Custom Enhancement**: The pip check extracts both pip version and associated Python version using regex pattern matching on the output format: `pip X.Y from ... (python Z.A)`

### 4. Programming Runtimes

| Runtime | Languages Supported | Check Method |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **JRE** | Java runtime | `java -version` |
| **JDK** | Java development | `javac -version` |
| **Go** | Golang | `go version` |

### 5. AI & Data Science Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Anaconda/Miniconda** | Python distribution for data science |
| **Jupyter** | Interactive notebook environment |
| **NVIDIA GPU Driver** | GPU acceleration via `nvidia-smi` |

### 6. Application Servers & Web Hosting

Checks for production-grade web servers:

- **Apache HTTPD**: Open-source web server
- **Nginx**: High-performance web server and reverse proxy
- **IIS**: Microsoft's Internet Information Services (Windows Feature check)

**IIS Detection**: Uses `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature` to verify the IIS-WebServerRole feature state.

### 7. Web & Frontend Development

Modern JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **npm**: Node package manager
- **pnpm**: Performant npm alternative
- **yarn**: Facebook's package manager

### 8. DevOps & Cloud Tools

Complete cloud-native development stack:

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| **Containerization** | Docker, Docker Compose |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes (kubectl), Helm |
| **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform |
| **Cloud Platforms** | Azure CLI, AWS CLI, Google Cloud CLI |

**Docker Compose Logic**: Attempts modern `docker compose` plugin first, then falls back to legacy `docker-compose` standalone binary.

### 9. Microsoft Stack

.NET and Visual Studio ecosystem:

- **.NET SDK**: Core .NET development kit
- **MSBuild**: Microsoft build engine
- **Visual Studio**: Full IDE (searches filesystem, reads metadata)
- **NuGet**: .NET package manager

**Visual Studio Challenge**: The script overcomes the issue of `devenv.exe` not being in PATH and hanging when executed by:
1. Searching `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio` recursively
2. Finding the most recent installation
3. Reading version info from file metadata instead of executing

### 10. Database Tools

| Database | Client Tool |
|----------|-------------|
| PostgreSQL | psql |
| MySQL | mysql |
| MongoDB | mongosh |
| SQLite | sqlite3 |

**Note**: PostgreSQL's `psql` outputs version info to stderr, requiring the `2>&1` redirection in the check function.

### 11. Version Control & Collaboration

- **Git**: Source control
- **Git LFS**: Large File Storage extension
- **SSH**: Secure Shell (uses `-V` flag with custom regex to extract clean version)
- **GPG**: GNU Privacy Guard for signing

**SSH Enhancement**: Uses regex pattern `OpenSSH_(\d+\.\d+p\d+)` to extract just the version number from verbose output.

### 12. Build & Package Managers

- **Gradle**: Java/Android build automation
- **Maven**: Java project management and build tool
- **Chocolatey**: Windows package manager
- **Winget**: Microsoft's official package manager

### 13. Utilities

Essential command-line tools:

- **curl.exe**: Data transfer tool (`.exe` suffix bypasses PowerShell alias)
- **wget**: Network downloader
- **OpenSSL**: Cryptography toolkit
- **tar**: Archive utility

---

## Output Format

### Real-Time Display

Each check produces immediate feedback:

```
[OK] Git found:
     Version: git version 2.42.0
```

```
[X] Docker not found or failed execution. Details: ...
```

```
[!] Virtualization platform (Hyper-V/VMP) NOT enabled. Docker may fail.
```

### Summary Table

At completion, a consolidated status report displays all results:

```
=== SUMMARY ===
[OK] PowerShell (7.4.0)
[OK] Git (git version 2.42.0)
[X] Docker
[!] Virtualization (Warning: Disabled)
...
```

**Color Coding:**
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** `[OK]`: Tool found and working
- ðŸ”´ **Red** `[X]`: Tool missing or failed
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** `[!]`: Warning or manual check required

---

## Error Handling Strategy

### Multi-Level Protection

1. **Function-Level**: Each `Check-Command` wrapped in try-catch
2. **Script-Level**: Main execution block wrapped in try-catch-finally
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed checks don't stop execution
4. **Descriptive Messages**: Error details displayed without technical jargon

### Exit Code Handling

The script properly handles tools that:
- Return non-zero exit codes on version checks (e.g., 7-Zip)
- Output to stderr instead of stdout (e.g., psql)
- Require elevation for certain checks (Windows Features)

### Console Title Preservation

**Critical Feature**: The script saves and restores the original console window title in the `finally` block, ensuring no persistent changes to the user's terminal session.

---

## Version History & Enhancements

### Version 3.2 (Current)

**Major Enhancement**: Custom pip parser displaying both pip and Python versions in format: `pip 25.2, Python 3.13`

**Implementation**:
```powershell
$parser = 'pip (\d+\.\d+).*\(python (\d+\.\d+)\)'
if ($versionString -match $parser) {
    $displayVersion = "pip $($Matches[1]), Python $($Matches[2])"
}
```

### Key Historical Improvements

- **v3.x**: Added registry-based tool discovery
- **v3.x**: Implemented file metadata reading for GUI apps
- **v3.x**: Enhanced multi-line output cleaning
- **v3.x**: Added support for Windows optional features

---

## Use Cases

### 1. Onboarding New Developers
Run script on new machines to verify complete environment setup and identify missing tools.

### 2. Pre-Project Audits
Before starting a new project, confirm all required dependencies are installed.

### 3. Troubleshooting Build Failures
When builds fail mysteriously, verify that all build tools are present and accessible.

### 4. Documentation Generation
Export the summary to create accurate "Development Environment" documentation sections.

### 5. CI/CD Agent Validation
Run on build agents to verify consistent tooling across the pipeline.

### 6. Migration Verification
After OS upgrades or machine migrations, confirm all tools were properly restored.

---

## Limitations & Considerations

### Administrative Privileges

Some checks require elevation:
- Windows Optional Feature queries (Hyper-V, IIS)
- Deep system configuration inspection

**Script Behavior**: Gracefully handles permission errors with warning messages rather than failing.

### PATH Dependency

Most checks rely on tools being in the system PATH. The script includes workarounds for:
- 7-Zip (registry search)
- Visual Studio (filesystem search)

**Future Enhancement**: Could be extended to search common installation directories for more tools.

### Version Format Variations

Different tools use wildly different version output formats:
- Single-line vs. multi-line
- Stdout vs. stderr
- JSON vs. plain text
- Marketing versions vs. semantic versions

The script includes custom parsing logic for problematic tools but may display verbose output for tools with unusual formats.

### Performance

Full execution typically takes 15-30 seconds depending on:
- Number of tools installed
- Disk I/O speed (for filesystem searches)
- Network connectivity (some tools query online versions)

---

## Extension Guide

### Adding New Tool Checks

To add a new tool, simply add a call in the appropriate category:

```powershell
Check-Command "toolname" "Display Name" "--version" "optional-regex-pattern"
```

### Creating Custom Parsers

For tools with complex output:

```powershell
Check-Command "tool" "Tool Name" "version" '(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)'
```

The regex pattern should capture the desired version string in group 1 (`$Matches[1]`).

### Adding New Categories

1. Add a section header:
```powershell
Write-Host "--- Checking New Category ---" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

2. Add checks within the section
3. Results automatically appear in the summary table

---

## Best Practices

### Running the Script

1. **Open PowerShell** (no elevation needed for most checks)
2. **Navigate to script location**: `cd C:\path\to\script`
3. **Execute**: `.\environment-checker.ps1`
4. **Review output**: Scroll through or redirect to file

### Interpreting Results

- **Focus on Red [X] items first**: These are completely missing
- **Investigate Yellow [!] warnings**: May indicate configuration issues
- **Verify versions match project requirements**: Green doesn't mean compatible

### Integration with Development Workflow

- **Run weekly** to catch accidental tool removals
- **Run after major updates** (Windows updates, tool upgrades)
- **Share results** when reporting environment-related bugs
- **Version control the script** alongside project documentation

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Script won't run - "Execution Policy" error  
**Solution**: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`

**Issue**: Many tools show as missing despite being installed  
**Solution**: Tools may not be in PATH. Add installation directories to system PATH.

**Issue**: Virtualization shows disabled but Docker works  
**Solution**: Script may not have admin rights. Run `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform` in elevated PowerShell.

**Issue**: Visual Studio not detected  
**Solution**: Check installation path matches expected location (`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\`)

---

## Technical Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows 10/11 or Windows Server 2016+
- **PowerShell**: Version 5.1 or higher (built into Windows)
- **Permissions**: Standard user for most checks, admin for platform features
- **Dependencies**: None - script is self-contained

---

## Security Considerations

- **Read-Only Operations**: Script performs no installations or modifications
- **No Network Calls**: Except for tools that inherently check online (e.g., `aws --version`)
- **No Credential Handling**: No passwords, tokens, or sensitive data accessed
- **Safe Execution**: All commands are version checks with no side effects

---

## Performance Optimization Tips

The script is already optimized, but for faster execution:

1. **Comment out unused categories**: If you don't do Python development, comment out that section
2. **Run in elevated PowerShell**: Eliminates permission-related retries
3. **Add tools to PATH**: Reduces time spent on registry/filesystem searches

---
